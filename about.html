        shopease’s “Day 1” mentality is our approach to doing everything with the energy and entrepreneurial spirit of a new organization on its first day.
        Working to earn and keep our customers’ trust is the single biggest driver of shopease’s Day 1 approach. shopease’s decision-making process asks employees to consider whether an action is a one-way door—consequential and nearly irreversible—or a two-way door, easy to change course and go back.
